House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned survived the attack to remove him from power, and exposed the treasonous acts brought forth by the crown of King's Landing. A new King was named and Ned along with Winterfell were allowed to rule seperately while agreeing to be strong allies should any major problems arise.

Joffrey Baratheon was the one to do Ned in, but his story was only about to begin, and let me assure you he will DEFINITELY NOT DIE!
